# Goal (incl. success criteria):
- UNCONFIRMED: Await user request; provide help in `codex-rs` workspace.

# Constraints/Assumptions:
- This is Azure Codex, a fork of OpenAI Codex CLI
- Rust workspace with 50+ crates
- Optimized for Azure OpenAI Service

- Network access is restricted in tool runs.

# Key decisions:
- N/A (no active task yet)

# State:
  - Done: Read `CONTINUITY.md` and refreshed it for a new session
  - Now: Waiting for the user to specify what they want to do
  - Next: Clarify the task scope (bug, feature, refactor, docs, etc.)

# Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- What do you want help with in this repo?

# Working set (files/ids/commands):
- `CONTINUITY.md`
